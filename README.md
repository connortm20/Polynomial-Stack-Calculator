# Polynomial-Stack-Calculator
Using a stack implementation, allow pushing polynomial objects, and basic polynomial arithmetic on the top elements.

included MakeFIle for linux g++ compilation.

## Commands  
‘d’ - this should simply remove all elements from the accumulator.   
’s’ - this should then allow the user to enter a polynomial and store it at the top of the accumulator.  
‘e’ - this should allow the user to type in a floating point number. The polynomial found at the top of the accumulator should then be evaluated at that value and the 
result printed.  
‘+’ - this should remove the top two values from the accumulator, add them together, and place the result on the top of the accumulator.    
‘-’ - this should remove the top two values from the accumulator, subtract them, and place the result on the top of the accumulator.   
‘*’ - this should remove the top two values from the accumulator, multiply them together, and place the result on the top of the accumulator.  
‘p’ - this should simply print the top value of the accumulator to the screen.  
‘q’ - this should just cause the program to terminate after printing a message like “Thank you for using polyCalc!”
